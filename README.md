## About Me

Hi! I'm Matias, a fullstack developer from Argentina.
Yes, you might see this README.md and think to yourself, "wait a minute, there ain't no documentation here", and while it may be bad practice, of course there isn't, this is a personal project to showcase my portfolio and resume to the WWW ("World Wide Web", not to be confused with a new Wild West "Wildest Wild West" perhaps), and it doesn't have really something worthy of detailing (API stuff, endpoints, etc.)

## Even More

I've been working and studying the world of web development since late 2019, started working as a Product Manager / Product Owner / Project Manager (roles weren't that clear really). Aldo since i was a child i already loved playing around with the internals of how programming worked (withouth really knowing what i was doing, and C++ drove me away a little bit)

## Where did i study and work?

After going to an art school, doing photography and cinema, i started a degree in Computer Science until early 2023, then i started working as a frontend (later a fullstack) developer in an Argentine company where i worked with many types of different clients and technologies, mostly with NextJS, React and Laravel
